# MTTN: Multi-Pair Text to Text Narratives for Prompt Generation

MTTN is a dataset which is aimed for text-2-text generation, with a focus on diffusion model prompts. The model trained on this data will be able to fill gaps and create natural propmts that can be used to generate images directly.

MTTN is derived from different popular text datasets, including MS-COCO, WiT, Flickr, Conceptual captions which were then merged with a large collection of independent prompts that were originally used for image generations. 
## Dataset Description

In MTTN we have taken all the textual data that was available from the above mentioned dataset and then
